# Scanner

This is the scanner part of the whole app. The scanner will look through the sheet.

# Apps Purpose

A Tracker that pulls the items bought from a sheet, shows them on an a shared app. Then you can see what you have and what you don't have. And if they have expired or you can set that they are gone or almost gone.

This would mimilize throwing out old stuff and buying more stuff that we arleady have. (A big problem throughout the world)
